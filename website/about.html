<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Soccer Locker is a nonprofit organization that is committed to giving children, teens, and young adults in impoverished areas a chance to
enjoy soccer. We believe that every child deserves the opportunity to be fit and active everyday, regardless of social or economic status. Our
founder, Amn Gremn, started our first local programs in Miami, Florida in 2001 and our headquarters remain there to this day. After his passing in
2018, we have carried on his motto of "soccer for everyone."</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>We accomplish our mission by employing about 1,300 coaches across the state of Florida, although we occasionally branch out to communities in South America
and Africa. It is estimated the we give about 130,000 kids the chance to play soccer every year. In total, since the start of the organization, approximately
2,000,000 children have participated in our programs.</p>
